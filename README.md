# Data Analysis and Model Building on the Swarm Behaviour Dataset

- After preprocessing and splitting the dataset into training and testing data, we train the data under 3 models:
  1. Logistic regression:
     - A statistical model used for binary classification tasks by predicting the probability of an event using a logistic function.
     - Accuracy: 0.8956760466712422
  3. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN):
     - A non-parametric classification algorithm that predicts the class of a data point based on the classes of its nearest neighbors.
     - Accuracy: 0.883321894303363
  5. Naive Bayes:
     - A probabilistic classification algorithm based on Bayes' theorem with an assumption of feature independence, often used for text classification and other simple classification tasks.
     - Accuracy: 0.4483527796842828
